# ARRJuly2022 Submission - CONTRASTE: A Multi-Task Approach Combined With Prompt-Based Contrastive Pre-Training For Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction

## Dataset
- Preprocessed ASTE datasets can be found under `14res`, `15res`, `16res` and `lap14`
- Preprocessed datasets for performing contrastive learning will be released upon acceptance of the paper.


## Codes
- `main.py` contains the fine-tuning code for ASTE.
- `utils.py` contains helper codes for post-processing and evaluation.
- `preprocessor.py` contains codes to preprocess the ASTE datasets.
- Code for pre-training the model with supervised contrastive learning will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

## Scripts
Contains the fine-tuning running scripts with different seed values and hyper-parameter configurations.
